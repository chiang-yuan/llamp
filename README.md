    <h4>Large Language Model Made Powerful for High-fidelity Materials Knowledge Retrieval and Distillation</h4>
</center>

> TL;DR: LLaMP is a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hiearchical ReAct agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with Materials Project to ground LLMs on high-fidelity materials informatics.

We are sorry! LLaMP is actually a homonym of **Large Language model [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)**. :wink: It empowers LLMs with scientific knowledge and reduces the likelihood of hallucination for materials data distillation.

<!-- LLaMP is a web-based assistant that allows you to explore and interact with materials data in a conversational and intuitive manner. It integrates the power of the Materials Project API and the intelligence of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for discovering and understanding computational materials data based on quantum mechanical calculations. -->

## :crystal_ball: Introduction

Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences where reproducibility is crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of multiple data-aware reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that dynamically interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP). Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates an ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structures and elastic tensors), and summarize multi-step procedures for solid-state synthesis. The proposed framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination free approach to exploring materials informatics and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.
