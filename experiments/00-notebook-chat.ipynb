      "Summary: A polaron is a quasiparticle used in condensed matter physics to understand the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The polaron concept was proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 and Solomon Pekar in 1946 to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms displace from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron's effective mass.\n",
      "The general concept of a polaron has been extended to describe other interactions between the electrons and ions in metals that result in a bound state, or a lowering of energy compared to the non-interacting system. Major theoretical work has focused on solving Fröhlich and Holstein Hamiltonians. This is still an active field of research to find exact numerical solutions to the case of one or two electrons in a large crystal lattice, and to study the case of many interacting electrons.\n",
      "Experimentally, polarons are important to the understanding of a wide variety of materials. The electron mobility in semiconductors can be greatly decreased by the formation of polarons. Organic semiconductors are also sensitive to polaronic effects, which is particularly relevant in the design of organic solar cells that effectively transport charge. Polarons are also important for interpreting the optical conductivity of these types of materials.\n",
      "The polaron, a fermionic quasiparticle, should not be confused with the polariton, a bosonic quasiparticle analogous to a hybridized state between a photon and an optical phonon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Rydberg polaron\n",
      "Summary: A Rydberg polaron is an exotic quasiparticle, created at low temperatures, in which a very large atom contains other ordinary atoms in the space between the nucleus and the electrons. For the formation of this atom, scientists had to combine two fields of atomic physics: Bose–Einstein condensates and Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are formed by exciting a single atom into a high-energy state, in which the electron is very far from the nucleus. Bose–Einstein condensates are a state of matter that is produced at temperatures close to absolute zero.\n",
      "Polarons are induced by using a laser to excite Rydberg atoms contained as impurities in a Bose–Einstein condensate. In those Rydberg atoms, the average distance between the electron and its nucleus can be as large as several hundred nanometres, which is more than a thousand times the radius of a hydrogen atom. Under these circumstances, the distance between the nucleus and the electron of the excited Rydberg atoms is higher than the average distance between the atoms of the condensate. As a result, some atoms lie inside the orbit of the Rydberg atom's electron.\n",
      "As the atoms don't have an electric charge, they only produce a minimal force on the electron. However, the electron is slightly scattered at the neutral atoms, without even leaving its orbit, and the weak bond that is generated between the Rydberg atom and the atoms inside of it, tying them together, is known as the Rydberg polaron. The excitation was predicted by theorists at Harvard University in 2016 and confirmed in 2018 by spectroscopy in an experiment using a strontium Bose–Einstein condensate. Theoretically, up to 170 ordinary strontium atoms could fit closely inside the new orbital of the Rydberg atom, depending on the radius of the Rydberg atom and the density of the Bose–Einstein condensate. The theoretical work for the experiment was performed by theorists at Vienna University of Technology and Harvard University, while the actual experiment and observation took place at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n",

      "Page: TI-polaron\n",
      "Summary: A TI-polaron (translation-invariant polaron) is a type of elementary quasiparticle in solid-state physics. The ground state of TI-polaron is a delocalized state of electron-phonon system: the probabilities of electron's occurrence at any point of a space\u001b[0mDo I need to use a tool? No\n",
      "Final Answer: A polaron is a quasiparticle used in condensed matter physics to understand the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. It represents an electron that is surrounded by a cloud of virtual phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibrations. This cloud acts to screen the charge of the electron, effectively increasing its mass and altering its electrical properties. Polarons are important for understanding the electrical and optical properties of various materials, including semiconductors and organic solar cells. There are also exotic types of polarons, such as Rydberg polarons, which involve a Rydberg atom containing other atoms within the space between its nucleus and electrons, and TI-polarons (translation-invariant polarons), which are delocalized states of the electron-phonon system.\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mDo I need to use a tool?

      "Summary: Superconductivity is a set of physical properties observed in certain materials where electrical resistance vanishes and magnetic fields are expelled from the material. Any material exhibiting these properties is a superconductor. Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor, whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered, even down to near absolute zero, a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero. An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.The superconductivity phenomenon was discovered in 1911 by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a phenomenon which can only be explained by quantum mechanics. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete cancelation of the magnetic field in the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.\n",
      "In 1986, it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 90 K (−183 °C). Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor, leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors. The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K (−196 °C) and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.\n",

      "Page: High-temperature superconductivity\n",
      "Summary: High-temperature superconductors (high-Tc or HTS) are defined as materials with critical temperature (the temperature below which the material behaves as a superconductor) above 77 K (−196.2 °C; −321.1 °F), the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.  They are only \"high-temperature\" relative to previously known superconductors, which function at even colder temperatures, close to absolute zero.  The \"high temperatures\" are still far below ambient (room temperature), and therefore require cooling.  The first break through of high-temperature superconductor was discovered in 1986 by IBM researchers Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller. Although the critical temperature is around 35.1 K (−238.1 °C; −396.5 °F), this new type of superconductor was readily modified by Ching-Wu Chu to make the first high-temperature superconductor with critical temperature 93 K (−180.2 °C; −292.3 °F). Bednorz and Müller were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1987 \"for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials\". Most high-Tc materials are type-II superconductors.\n",
      "The major advantage of high-temperature superconductors is that they can be cooled using liquid nitrogen, in contrast to the previously known superconductors that require expensive and hard-to-handle coolants, primarily liquid helium. A second advantage of high-Tc materials is they retain their superconductivity in higher magnetic fields than previous materials.  This is important when constructing superconducting magnets, a primary application of high-Tc materials.\n",
      "The majority of high-temperature superconductors are ceramic materials, rather than the previously known metallic materials.  Ceramic superconductors are suitable for some practical uses but they still have many manufacturing issues. For example,  most ceramics are brittle, which makes the fabrication of wires from them very problematic.  However, overcoming these drawbacks is the subject  of considerable research, and progress is ongoing.The main class of high-temperature superconductors is copper oxides combined with other metals, especially the rare-earth barium copper oxides (REBCOs) such as yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO).
