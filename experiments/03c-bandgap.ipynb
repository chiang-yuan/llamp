The electrical conductivity depends on the concentration of electrons in the conduction band and the mobility of the electrons. In semiconductors and insulators, at zero K the conduction band is empty. So teher are no free electrons and the conductivity is zero.

The electrical conductivity depends on the concentration of electrons in the conduction band and the mobility of the electrons. In semiconductors and insulators, at zero K the conduction band is empty. So teher are no free electrons and the conductivity is zero. As the temperature increases some electrons from the valence band are excited into the conduction band. So the conductivity becomes non-zero but it is still much lower than in metals. This is due to the fact that the concentration of free electrons is much lower than in metals, even at room temperature. This can be related to the fact that the average thermal energy at room temperature is about 1/40 eV whereas the band gap of typical semiconductors is of the order of 1eV and more (germanium has a little less than 1 eV, about 0.6 eV).

The electrical conductivity depends on the concentration of electrons in the conduction band and the mobility of the electrons. In semiconductors and insulators, at zero K the conduction band is empty. So teher are no free electrons and the conductivity is zero. As the temperature increases some electrons from the valence band are excited into the conduction band. So the conductivity becomes non-zero but it is still much lower than in metals. This is due to the fact that the concentration of free electrons is much lower than in metals, even at room temperature. This can be related to the fact that the average thermal energy at room temperature is about 1/40 eV whereas the band gap of typical semiconductors is of the order of 1eV and more (germanium has a little less than 1 eV, about 0.6 eV).
