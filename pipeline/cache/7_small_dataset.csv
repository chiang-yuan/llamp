- The atomic mass of Ge (Germanium) = 72.63 g/mol
- The atomic mass of Ru (Ruthenium) = 101.07 g/mol

Now, to find the mass density and volume per atom, we need to know the crystal structure of BeGeRu2. However, without this information, it is not possible to provide the exact mass density and volume per atom.

If you have the crystal structure information, you can use the following formulas to calculate the mass density and volume per atom:

Mass density (ρ) = Molar mass / Volume of the unit cell

1. Calculate the molar mass:
Er: 167.259 g/mol
Ge: 72.63 g/mol
Rh: 102.90550 g/mol

Molar mass of Er4Ge6Rh7 = (4*167.259) + (6*72.63) + (7*102.90550)
                            = 669.036 + 435.78 + 720.3385
                            ≈ 1825.1545 g/mol

2. Calculate the volume:
Assuming the compound has a crystal structure, we can use the formula:
Volume = (Z * V_cell) / N_A

Where:
Z = number of formula units per cell
V_cell = volume of the unit cell
N_A = Avogadro's number

For Er4Ge6Rh7, we need to know the crystal structure to determine Z and V_cell.

3. Calculate mass density:
Mass density = molar mass / volume
                = 1825.1545 g/mol / V_cell

4. Calculate volume per atom:
We need to know the number of atoms per formula unit and the volume of the unit cell to calculate the volume per atom.

Without the specific crystal structure of Er4Ge6Rh7, it is not possible to calculate the volume per atom or the mass density accurately.",0.6235,2.65,,

The atomic mass of Be (Beryllium) = 9.012 g/mol
The atomic mass of Ru (Ruthenium) = 101.07 g/mol

The proportion of Be and Ru in Be2Ru is 2:1

So, the molar mass of Be2Ru = 2*(9.012 g/mol) + 101.07 g/mol = 119.094 g/mol

The volume per atom of Be2Ru can be calculated by finding the volume of the unit cell and dividing it by the total number of atoms in the unit cell. However, this information is not readily available.

Therefore, the mass density of Be2Ru = molar mass / molar volume
                                      = 119.094 g/mol / molar volume

Unfortunately, without the specific volume per atom or the unit cell information, we cannot calculate the volume per atom or the mass density of Be2Ru.",N/A,6.93,N/A,N/A
